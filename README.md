Simple example showing how to control an SoC clock path

Described in more detail in the SiFive forum discussions as [Understanding the PRCI clock path](https://forums.sifive.com/t/understanding-the-prci-clock-path/5827).

Implments the following state machine to make clock path transitioning efficient and fool-proof.

State machine primitives are in source file [prci.s](https://github.com/psherman42/Demonstrating-PRCI/blob/main/prci.s)

It is a simple matter to get into any clock path. First, initialize the state machine, which always starts in the external direct path (assuming there is an external oscillator or other source connected):

    clock_init_xdir();

Tben invoke primitive functions as desired. For example, from the HFX DIR path th the HFR DIR path,

    clock_xdir_rdir(5, 8);  // hfrdiv, hfrtrim

And so forth, into the HFX PLL, HFR PLL, and back to the HFX DIR paths, respectively,

    clock_rdir_xpll(1, 31, 3, -1);  // pllr, pllf, pllq, plld
    clock_xpll_rpll(5, 8, 1, 31, 3, -1);  // hfrdiv, hfrtrim, pllr, pllf, pllq, plld
    clock_rpll_xdir();
    ...

Freuqncy in Hz of a ring oscillator composed of *b* inverter gates each *a* delay units long is given by the following equation.

$\Large Hz=\frac{1}{a \cdot (1 - \frac{(trim - 16)}{b}))}$

Where *trim* is the five-bit value from 0 to 31 (expressed as signed 2's complement from -16 to +15), and design paramters of two ring oscillators, **HFR** (PRCI block base 0x1000 8000) and **LFR** (AON block base 0x1000 0000), in the FE310 SoC have been determined empirically as:

**HFR**: a=11.558, b=35

**LFR**: a=8.728, b=31

In general eleven steps must be carefully followed when making transition from one clock path mode to another.

#### HFX DIR

The clock path derived from external crystal (or other) source, progressing directly through to the SoC, looks like this. Depending on transition to the next clock path state, some of the eleven steps are redundant and have been removed for speed, code size, and brevity.
